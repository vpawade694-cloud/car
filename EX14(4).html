Mercedes-Benz (German pronunciation: [mɛʁˌtseːdəs ˈbɛnts, -dɛs -] ⓘ),[6][7][a] 
commonly referred to simply as Mercedes and occasionally as Benz, is a German 
automotive brand that was founded in 1926. Mercedes-Benz AG (a subsidiary of the
Mercedes-Benz Group, established in 2019) is based in Stuttgart, Baden-Württemberg,
Germany. Mercedes-Benz AG manufactures luxury vehicles and light commercia
vehicles, all branded under the Mercedes-Benz name. From November 2019 onwards, 
the production of Mercedes-Benz-branded heavy commercial vehicles (trucks and buses) 
has been managed by Daimler Truck, which separated from the Mercedes-Benz Group to 
form an independent entity at the end of 2021.

In 2018, Mercedes-Benz became the world’s largest premium vehicle brand, 
with a sales volume of 2.31 million passenger cars.

<h2><u>HISTORY</u></h2>
Mercedes-Benz traces its origins to Carl Benz's first internal combustion 
engine in a car, seen in the Benz Patent-Motorwagen – financed by Bertha Benz's 
dowry and patented in January 1886 – and Gottlieb Daimler and their engineer 
Wilhelm Maybach's conversion of a stagecoach, with the addition of a petrol engine, 
introduced later that year. The Mercedes automobile was first marketed in 1901 by Daimler 
Motoren Gesellschaft (DMG).

Emil Jellinek-Mercedes, an Austrian automobile entrepreneur who worked with DMG, 
registered the trademark in 1902, naming the 1901 Mercedes 35 hp after his daughter 
Mercedes Jellinek. Jellinek was a businessman and marketing strategist who promoted 
"horseless" Daimler automobiles among the highest circles of society. At the time, 
it was a meeting place for the haute volée of France and Europe, especially in winter. 
His customers included the Rothschild family and other wealthy clients, but as early as 
1901, he was selling Mercedes cars in the "New World" as well, including to billionaires 
Rockefeller, Astor, Morgan, and Taylor. At the Nice race he attended in 1899, Jellinek 
drove under the pseudonym "Monsieur Mercédès". Many consider that race the birth of 
Mercedes-Benz as a brand. In 1901, the name "Mercedes" was re-registered by DMG worldwide 
as a protected trademark. The first Mercedes-Benz branded vehicles were produced in 1926, 
following the merger of Karl Benz and Gottlieb Daimler's companies into the Daimler-Benz 
company on 28 June of the same year.

Gottlieb Daimler (1834–1900) – founder of Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft
Gottlieb Daimler was born on 17 March 1834 in Schorndorf. After training as a gunsmith 
and working in France, he attended the Polytechnic School in Stuttgart from 1857 to 1859. 
After completing various technical activities in France and England, he started working as 
a draftsman in Geislingen in 1862. At the end of 1863, he was appointed workshop inspector 
at a machine-tool factory in Reutlingen, where he met Wilhelm Maybach in 1865.

<h2><u>QUALITY RANKING </u></h2>
The roots of the brand trace back to the 1901 Mercedes by Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft 
and the 1886 Benz Patent-Motorwagen and 1894 Benz Velo by Carl Benz, which is widely 
recognized as the first automobile powered by an internal combustion engine. 
The brand’s slogan is "The Best or Nothing".
Before the mid 1990s, Mercedes-Benz had a very strong reputation for quality and durability. 
Mercedes-Benz's passenger cars were considered "tanks" or "indestructible" by owners who 
had their own Mercedes for very long periods. Some objective reviewers looking at passenger 
vehicles, such as J. D. Power surveys, demonstrated a downturn in reputation by these criteria 
in the late 1990s and early 2000s. By mid-2005, Mercedes temporarily returned to the industry 
average for initial quality, a measure of problems after the first 90 days of ownership, according 
to J. D. Power. In J. D. Power's Initial Quality Study for the first quarter of 2007, Mercedes 
showed dramatic improvement by climbing from 25th to 5th place and earning several awards for its 
newer models. For 2008, Mercedes-Benz's initial quality rating improved by yet another mark, to 
4th place. On top of this accolade, it also received the Platinum Plant Quality Award for their 
Mercedes branded Sindelfingen, Germany body assembly plant. J. D. Power's 2011 US Initial Quality 
and Vehicle Dependability Studies both ranked Mercedes-Benz vehicles above average in build quality and 
reliability. In J. D. Power's United Kingdom Survey in 2011, Mercedes cars were rated above average. 
Additionally, iSeeCars.com study for Reuters in 2014 found Mercedes to have the lowest vehicle recall rate 
out of competitors
