The Mercedes-Benz C-Class is a series of compact executive cars produced by Mercedes-Benz Group AG.
 Introduced in 1993 as a replacement for the 190 (W201) range, the C-Class was the smallest model 
in the marque's line-up until the W168 A-Class arrived in 1997. The C-Class has been available with a "4MATIC" 
four-wheel drive option since 2002. The third generation(W204) was launched in 2007 while the current W206generation was launched in 2021.

In 1972, Mercedes-Benz introduced the W116 line, the first to be officially called the S-Class.[5] Produced from 1972 through 1980, the W116 series featured a four-wheel independent suspension and disc brakes. The 280, 350, and 450 (4.5L version) models featured SE and SEL versions. Production of the W116 totaled 473,035 units. This was a groundbreaking sedan for Mercedes-Benz, and for the first time in the company history, the car had an obvious, blatant and outward emphasis on safety placed above a pure styling viewpoint. The overall design incorporated numerous safety features developed from the "safety research vehicles" in the mid-to-late 1960s to the very early 1970s.

The 500 units of the G 500 and G 55 AMG Grand Edition were built and shipped to the United States when Mercedes-Benz decided to end the sales of G-Class in the United States for 2006 before rescinding its decision. The exterior had an exclusive Allanite Grey Magno metallic paint finish and brushed aluminium trim stripes with "Grand Edition" lettering. The interior had matte-silk wood trim on the dashboard and centre console, designo exclusive leather upholstery, and door sills with illuminated "Grand Edition" lettering.
